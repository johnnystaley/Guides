HTML
I. Basics
    A. HTML: HyperText Markup Language
        a. Used as the basis for website layouts
    B. Useful Tools
        a. Live Server extension
            i. Allows you to preview website changes without deploying to the internet
    C. Structure 
        a. Any <tag> followed with the text between </tag> is considered an entire element. This example would be a tag element
        b. <!DOCTYPE html>
            i. Begin html files with <!DOCTYPE html> to let browsers know the file is an html document
        c. <html></html> These are html tags
            i. These surround all of the code in the document to define the root
        d. <head></head> These are the head tags
            i. Represents information about a web page that the user may not see
            ii. <title>Sample Title</title> These are title tags
                1.Displays the title of the webpage in the browser tab
        e. <body></body> These are body tags
            i. The body is what is displayed to the user
            ii. <h1></h1> These are header tags
                1.header tags are defined by h and the corresponding number to indicate the header characteristics from the css file
                2. Generally they get smaller from h1 to h6
            iii. <p></p> These are paragraph tags
                1. Used to display text in paragraph format
                2. <p> tags will include a break between them if used in sequence
            iv. <br></br> These are line break tags
                1. Functions the same as pressing enter and skipping a line in word
            v. <hr> This is a horizontal rule tag
                1. Adds a horizontal line to the page that can be used to break up bodies of text
            vi. <!-- --> This is the comment tag
                1. Anything between the comment tag arrows will not affect the look or function of the webpage
II. Hyperlinks
    A. Hyperlinks can be applied to any piece of text, images, elements, and buttons
    B.Creating a hyperlink
        a. <a></a> These are a tags
        b. To create a hyperlink, surround an element with a tags
            i. Within the first a tag, define your link using <a href = “https://www.sample.com”>
    C. Hyperlink Characteristics
        a. By default, a hyperlink will open the page in the same tab. To open to a new tab, add a target attribute after the link and set it to _blank
            i. Ex: <a href = “https://www.sample.com” target = _blank>
            ii. To set the hyperlink to open to the same tab, change the target to _self
        b. You can also add a title to the hyperlink which will display a small popup box prior to clicking on the link. 
            i. Ex: <a href = “https://www.sample.com” title = “sample”>
        c. You can also set hyperlinks equal to the titles of other html files in your document to navigate between them.
            i. Ex: <a href = “sample.html”>
        d. With the appropriate framework, you can also send emails with hyperlinks using the mailto hyperlink element
            i.Ex: <a href = “mailto:sample123@gmail.com”>
                    sample message
			      </a>
III. Images
    A. Adding images
        a. <img></img> These are image tags
        b. Images have modifiable attributes that can be used to define their parameters
            i. src is the source attribute
                1. The source attribute can be used to define the source of an image from the document files
                    a. Ex: <img src = “sample.png”>
                2. If the image is being sourced from within a folder, you will need to reference that in the src attribute
                    a. Ex: <img src = “images/sample.png”>
            ii. height and width are other image attributes that can be adjusted via pixel size
                1. The height and width scale proportionally with each other, but can also be adjusted individually to change the aspect ratio of the image
                    a. Ex: <img src = “sample.png” height=“300” width=“100”>
            iii. alt is an attribute that can be used to add a description of an image for accessibility
                1. This is good for those who are visually impaired and may be using screen readers
                    a. Ex: <img src = “sample.png” alt=“sample description”>
            iv. title is an attribute that can be used to add a pop up box when hovering over the image
                1. Ex: <img src = “sample.png” title=“sample title”>
    B. Image Hyperlinks
        a. Images can be turned into hyperlinks using the same methods defined in the hyperlinks guide.
            i. Ex:  <a href=“https://www.sample.com”>
                        <img src = “sample.png”>
                    </a>
IV. Audio
    A. Adding audio
        a. <audio> this is an audio tag
        b. Audio elements receive sources through the same source attribute as images, however they also require a boolean attribute known as controls to set the src to true
            i. Ex: <audio controls src = “sample.mp3”>
        c. autoplay is another boolean attribute which will autoplay the sound file upon the page loading
            i. Ex: <audio controls autoplay src = “sample.mp3”>
        d. muted is yet another boolean attribute which will mute the sound file upon the page loading
            i. Ex: <audio controls autoplay muted src = “sample.mp3”>
        e. loop is another boolean attribute which will loop the sound file continuously
            i. Ex: <audio controls autoplay loop src = “sample.mp3”>
    B. Backup audio
        a. You can include backup audio files in the case that a web browser does not support the given format. To do this, you should create multiple nested source elements within the audio element. (This requires an audio closing tag)
            i. Ex:  <audio controls autoplay loop>
                        <source src = “sample.mp3”>
                        <source src = “sample.wav”>
                        This browser does not support HTML5 audio
			       </audio>
            ii. In the event that none of the audio files are compatible with the browser, the message above will display in their place.
V. Video
    A. Adding video
        a. <video> This is a video tag
        b. Video elements work similarly to audio and image elements with controls functioning as the boolean attribute to play the video file
            i. Ex: <video controls src = “sample.mp4”>
        c. All attributes that apply to images and audio apply to videos as well including width and height and muted
            i. Ex: <video controls muted src = “sample.mp4” width=”500”>
        d. The autoplay attribute does not require controls to play a video file
            i. Ex: <video autoplay src = “sample.mp4”>
    B. Backup video
        a. You can include backup video files in the case that a web browser does not support the given format. To do this, you should create multiple nested source elements within the video element. (This requires a video closing tag)
            i. Ex:  <video controls autoplay loop>
                        <source src = “sample.mp4”>
                        <source src = “sample.WebM”>
                        This browser does not support HTML5 video
			       </video>
